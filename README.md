Preview the document: Should be used to build your models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (survival) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender, class and fare.

test.csv:
Preview the document: Should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the survival for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
